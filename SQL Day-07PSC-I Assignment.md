# Easy Level
## 1. Understanding JOINS (Theoretical)
    Explain the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` with real-world examples.

Solution:-
`INNER JOIN` => It will fetch the row from both the table where common doesn't have any null values.
- Imagine we have a student table and a subject table. Inner Join will only give the records who opted for subject and subject which have student.

`LEFT JOIN` => It will fetch the row from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there's no matching in the right table then it will return `null` values.
- If we Join student table  and subject table then it will return all the students. Even those who have not opted for Subject Yet.

`RIGHT JOIN` => It will fetch the row from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If there's no matching in the left table then it will return `null` values.
- If we Join student table  and subject table then it will return all the subject. Even those where no student is present.

`FULL OUTER JOIN` => It will return All the rows from both the table irrespective of the null values.
- It will return all the rows of student table and all the subject table.

## 2. Customers & Orders
- Given tables:
        customers(customer_id, name, email)
        orders(order_id, customer_id, total_amount, order_date)
- Write an SQL query to:
- Retrieve all customers who have placed an order.

        ```SQL
        SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
        FROM customers c
        INNER JOIN orders o
        ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
        ```
        List orders along with the customer names.

        ```SQL
        SELECT o.order_id, c.name
        FROM orders o
        INNER JOIN customers c 
        ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
        ```

        Find customers who haven’t placed any orders.

        ```SQL
        SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email, o.order_id
        FROM customers c
        LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
        WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
        ```


## 3. Employees & Departments
- Given tables:
        employees(emp_id, name, department_id, salary)
        departments(department_id, dept_name)
- Write a query to:
- Retrieve all employees and their department names, ensuring employees without a department are still listed.

```SQL
SELECT e.emp_id, e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

- Find departments that have no employees.

```SQL
SELECT d.department_id, d.dept_name, e.emp_id
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
WHERE e.emp_id IS NULL;
```


4. Filtering with Aggregation & JOIN
- Given tables:
        students(student_id, name)
        courses(course_id, title)
        enrollments(student_id, course_id, grade)
- Write a query to:
- Retrieve the average grade per course.

```SQL
SELECT c.title, AVG(e.grade) AS Average_Grade
FROM enrollments e
JOIN courses c
ON e.course_id = c.course_id
GROUP BY c.title;
```

- List students who are not enrolled in any courses.

```SQL

SELECT s.student_id, s.name , e.student_id
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id
WHERE e.course_id IS NULL;

```


- Find students who scored above the course average grade.

```SQL

SELECT e.student_id, s.name, e.course_id, c.title, e.grade
FROM enrollments e
JOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE e.grade > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.grade)
    FROM enrollments e2
    WHERE e2.course_id = e.course_id
);


```
